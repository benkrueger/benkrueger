# Hello, my name is Benjamin Krueger

I am a Sr DevOps engineer at Accenture Federal Services. I studied computer science at the University Of Missouri St Louis, and have a variety of experiences in 
software development and information technology. I keep this github around for personal projects and as storage for configuragtion and infrastructure code.
I have a strong interest in computing as a whole but my main area of focus is in cybersecurity, networking, and data science.
